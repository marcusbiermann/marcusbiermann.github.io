    description: This paper analyzes the consequences of the change in the
      presentation mode of economics seminars triggered by the COVID-19
      pandemic. The composition of seminar speakers changed significantly. The
      leading economists gained shares. The share of seminars held by women also
      increased. The geography of knowledge dissemination shifted significantly
      as the distance between host and speaker institutions increased on average
      by 32 percent. The growing inequality in presentations among speakers is
      correlated with an increase in inequality in terms of citations. The
      results imply that virtual presentations instead of traveling can decrease
      gender-specific inequality and increase inequality by productivity in the
      profession.
  - title: Tracing the International Transmission of a Crisis Through Multinational
      Firms
    subtitle: (with Kilian Huber), Revision requested by the Journal of Finance,
      February 2021

    description: " This paper shows that idiosyncratic shocks to individual firms
      can affect growth all over the world, even if shocked firms have no direct
      foreign connections and no operations abroad. We identify an idiosyncratic
      shock to a German bank, which caused the bank to cut lending to German
      borrowers. Multinational parent firms located in Germany became
      financially constrained. In response, international affiliates of affected
      parents supported their parent by lending through internal capital markets
      and became constrained themselves. The real growth of affiliates fell
      sharply and took three years to fully recover. Though the initial shock
      only hit the domestic activities of a firm in Germany, the impact in other
      countries was sizable (for instance, around 0.4 percent of aggregate sales
      in Austria and the Czech Republic). The findings reveal that idiosyncratic
      shocks to individual firms influence economic outcomes far beyond firms’
      direct scope of operation."

    description: This paper investigates how management practices as intangible
      transfers are associated with the performance of multinational business
      groups. Differences in the management level across source countries are
      predictive for multinationals’ entry patterns for a given destination
      country. This study uses acquisitions as a means to transplant management
      practices from parents to affiliates abroad. It finds that better-managed
      parents decrease employment and increase productivity post-acquisition.
      The productivity gains are driven by targets with less developed
      management practices and by targets of larger parents. Better-managed
      parents are also more likely to install or retain a manager from the
      parent country post-acquisition.

    description: What effect did trade have on the size distribution of firms during
      the first wave of globalization? Three historical datasets from the German
      Empire between 1875 and 1907 were collected and harmonized to answer this
      question. This paper combines industry census and bilateral railway trade
      data from the same industry and region along with industry-level tariff
      data. The evidence shows that increases in aggregate trade caused the
      share of firms to shift from smaller to larger firms. Exogenous decreases
      in tariffs caused an increase in the share of the largest firms. The
      regional distributive effects of trade on inequality between firms that
      are discussed in the contemporaneous literature were already present
      during the first wave globalization.
