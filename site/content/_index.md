      We study how multinational firms transmit shocks across countries through
      their internal

      capital markets. We identify a lending cut by a single German bank, which
      reduced the

      credit supply of multinational parents located in Germany. Using detailed
      data on internal

      capital markets, we show that multinationals adjusted internal capital
      flows toward affected parents and away from international affiliates.
      Affiliate sales fell sharply and recovered after three years. The results
      indicate that preexisting internal capital market positions can be used to
      predict the degree of cross-country shock transmission and that
      idiosyncratic shocks from “granular” banks in one country affect growth
      internationally.

      What is the effect of trade on the size distribution of firms? To answer
      this question, I

      collected historical data from between 1875 and 1907 from the German
      Empire. I was then able to match industry census data with bilateral
      railway trade from the same region and with tariff data from the same
      industry. I show that plausibly exogenous tariff movements caused a shift
      in the firm size distribution from medium-sized firms to larger firms. I
      observed a prominent shift in employment and firm share from smaller to
      larger firm size categories following increases in trade openness. I use a
      Bartik instrument to show that the correlations described are indeed
      causal.

      This paper investigates how management practices as intangible assets are
      associated with performance of multinational business groups. I show that
      management practices of parents and affiliates are positively correlated.
      In the cross-section, better parent management practices are positively
      correlated with affiliate size and productivity. I use acquisitions as an
      event-study and find that better managed parents decrease employment
      post-acquisition. The positive correlation of parent management practices
      and affiliate productivity is strengthened, when the affiliate is in the
      first level of the corporate hierarchy or when the source country is more
      developed than the destination country in terms of income.
