      We study how internal capital markets of multinational corporations
      transmit shocks

      across countries. We identify an exogenous shock to the credit supply of
      multinational

      parents located in Germany. Using detailed data on financial linkages
      between parents and

      affiliates, we show that multinationals adjusted internal capital flows
      (internal loans and

      equity investments) away from international affiliates and toward the
      parent after the shock

      to the parent. Sales of affiliates fell sharply and recovered after three
      years. Affiliates

      with larger preexisting internal capital market linkages to the parent
      were more strongly

      affected. A back-of-the-envelope calculation based on our estimates
      implies that a global

      banking crisis outside the US could reduce aggregate sales in the US by 1
      percent, solely

      because multinationals transmit the crisis to the US through their
      internal networks.

      What is the effect of supply potential on the size distribution of firms?
      I collected historical data between 1882 and 1907 from the German Empire
      to address this question. I can then match two data sets according to the
      same geographic boundaries: industry census data and bilateral railway
      trade data. The key findings are that supply potential impacts the firm
      size distribution heterogeneously across five size categories. I find
      evidence of a hierarchical and stark shift in employment and firm share
      from the smallest toward larger firm size categories. A distance
      instrument is proposed to argue that the correlations described are indeed
      causal. I provide evidence for a fall in trade costs and technology
      adoption as mechanisms to explain the stylized facts observed in the data.

      This paper investigates how management practices as intangible assets are
      associated with performance of multinational business groups. I show that
      management practices of parents and affiliates are positively correlated.
      In the cross-section, better parent management practices are positively
      correlated with affiliate size and productivity. I use acquisitions as an
      event-study and find that better managed parents decrease employment
      post-acquisition. The positive correlation of parent management practices
      and affiliate productivity is strengthened, when the affiliate is in the
      first level of the corporate hierarchy or when the source country is more
      developed than the destination country in terms of income.
