      We study how multinational firms transmit shocks across countries through
      their internal

      capital markets. We identify a lending cut by a single German bank, which
      reduced the

      credit supply of multinational parents located in Germany. Using detailed
      data on internal

      capital markets, we show that multinationals adjusted internal capital
      flows toward affected parents and away from international affiliates.
      Affiliate sales fell sharply and recovered after three years. The results
      indicate that preexisting internal capital market positions can be used to
      predict the degree of cross-country shock transmission and that
      idiosyncratic shocks from “granular” banks in one country affect growth
      internationally.

      What effect did trade have on the size distribution of firms during the
      first wave of globalization? Three historical datasets from the German
      Empire between 1875 and 1907 were collected and harmonized to answer this
      question. This paper uses industry census and bilateral railway trade data
      from the same industry and region along with tariff data from the same
      industry. The evidence shows that increases in aggregate trade caused the
      share of firms to shift from smaller to larger firms. Exogenous decreases
      in tariffs caused an increase in the share of the largest firms. The
      regional distributive effects of trade on inequality between firms that
      are discussed in the contemporaneous literature were already present
      during the first wave globalization.

      This paper investigates how management practices as intangible transfers
      are associated with the performance of multinational business groups.
      Differences in the management level across source countries are predictive
      for multinationals’ entry patterns for a given destination country. This
      study uses acquisitions as a means to transplant management practices from
      parents to affiliates abroad. It finds that better-managed parents
      decrease affiliates’ employment and increase affiliates’ productivity
      post-acquisition. Better-managed parents are also more likely to install
      or retain a manager from the home country post-acquisition.
