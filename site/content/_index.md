      We show that internal capital markets of multinationals have large real
      effects and transmit shocks across countries. Our approach combines
      detailed micro data on internal capital markets with a quasi-experimental
      research design. Following an exogenous lending cut by a large German bank
      in 2008/09, parents of German multinationals became financially
      constrained. We find that affiliates of affected parents increased net
      lending to their parent after the lending cut. Affiliates were unable to
      raise external funding and instead had to reduce real activities to
      finance internal lending. As a result, affiliate sales fell sharply and
      took three years to fully recover. Effects were largest for affiliates
      that lent more to the parent and had weak access to external finance.
      Though the bank lending cut only directly hit firms located in Germany,
      the impact in other countries was large, due to transmission through
      multinationals (over 0.3 percent of aggregate sales in Austria, Czech
      Republic, and Poland). We argue that internal capital flows can affect the
      distribution of firm growth in most countries, since internal capital
      markets are large relative to aggregate capital flows and output.

      What effect did trade have on the size distribution of firms during the
      first wave of globalization? Three historical datasets from the German
      Empire between 1875 and 1907 were collected and harmonized to answer this
      question. This paper combines industry census and bilateral railway trade
      data from the same industry and region along with industry-level tariff
      data. The evidence shows that increases in aggregate trade caused the
      share of firms to shift from smaller to larger firms. Exogenous decreases
      in tariffs caused an increase in the share of the largest firms. The
      regional distributive effects of trade on inequality between firms that
      are discussed in the contemporaneous literature were already present
      during the first wave globalization.

      This paper investigates how management practices as intangible transfers
      are associated with the performance of multinational business groups.
      Differences in the management level across source countries are predictive
      for multinationals’ entry patterns for a given destination country. This
      study uses acquisitions as a means to transplant management practices from
      parents to affiliates abroad. It finds that better-managed parents
      decrease affiliates’ employment and increase affiliates’ productivity
      post-acquisition. Better-managed parents are also more likely to install
      or retain a manager from the home country post-acquisition.
