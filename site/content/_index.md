      We study whether multinational corporations transmit the effects of a
      localized banking crisis to countries all over the world. We identify an
      exogenous shock to the credit supply of multinational parent corporations
      located in Germany. The shock to parents caused a reduction in the sales
      of their international affiliates for three years. We use unique data on
      linkages between parents and affiliates to study the transmission
      mechanism from parents’ credit supply to affiliates’ sales. Both financial
      constraints and intrafirm trade played a role: Parents withdrew equity
      from their affiliates, required more long-term lending from the
      affiliates, and traded less with their affiliates. The results improve our
      understanding of the internal operations of multinational firms and
      suggest that multinationals contribute to global business cycle
      synchronization.

      What is the effect of supply potential on the size distribution of firms?
      I collected historical data between 1882 and 1907 from the German Empire
      to address this question. I can then match two data sets according to the
      same geographic boundaries: industry census data and bilateral railway
      trade data. The key findings are that supply potential impacts the firm
      size distribution heterogeneously across five size categories. I find
      evidence of a hierarchical and stark shift in employment and firm share
      from the smallest toward larger firm size categories. A distance
      instrument is proposed to argue that the correlations described are indeed
      causal. I provide evidence for a fall in trade costs and technology
      adoption as mechanisms to explain the stylized facts observed in the data.

      This paper investigates how management practices as intangible assets are
      associated with performance of multinational business groups. I show that
      management practices of parents and affiliates are positively correlated.
      In the cross-section, better parent management practices are positively
      correlated with affiliate size and productivity. I use acquisitions as an
      event-study and find that better managed parents decrease employment
      post-acquisition. The positive correlation of parent management practices
      and affiliate productivity is strengthened, when the affiliate is in the
      first level of the corporate hierarchy or when the source country is more
      developed than the destination country in terms of income.
