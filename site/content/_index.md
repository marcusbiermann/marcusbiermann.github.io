    description: This paper investigates how firms' international linkages to Russia
      and Ukraine affected investors' expectations following the escalation of
      the Russian-Ukrainian war. For this, we perform an event study around the
      Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, finding that firms with
      significant trade activity with Russia experienced a substantial reduction
      in cumulative returns. The effect on cumulative returns is especially
      pronounced for firms that are dependent on Russian commodities. The impact
      on the aggregate stock market performance of third countries was on
      average 0.8 percentage points. The highest losses were borne by European
      countries.

    description: Drawing on the acknowledgements of more than 2,000 publications in
      the top five journals, this article documents that seminar presentations
      are concentrated among 12 top institutions and geographically in the
      Americas. Second, this study finds that there is a robust and significant
      correlation between presenting at Harvard University and publishing in the
      Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE) and between presenting at the
      University of Chicago and publishing in the Journal of Political Economy
      (JPE). Articles presented at Harvard and published in the QJE have, on
      average, a similar impact in terms of citations compared to other QJE
      articles, while also exhibiting a larger variance in terms of citations.
      Articles presented at Chicago and published in the JPE have, on average, a
      similar impact in terms of citations as other articles published in JPE.

  - title: Tracing the International Transmission of a Crisis Through Multinational
      Firms
    headline: Publications
    description: We show that multinational firms transmit shocks across countries
      through their internal capital markets. We study a credit supply shock to
      parent firms in Germany. International affiliates outside Germany
      supported their parents through internal lending, became financially
      constrained themselves, and experienced lower real growth. We find that
      managers were "Darwinist" with respect to international affiliates but
      "Socialist" in the home country, that internal capital markets transmitted
      the credit shock more strongly than a non-financial shock, and that access
      to developed credit markets attenuated the real effects. The total real
      impact of shock transmission through multinationals on foreign economies
      was large.

  - title: "Remote Talks: Changes to Economics Seminars During COVID-19"
    description: This paper analyzes the consequences of the change in the
      presentation mode of economics seminars triggered by the COVID-19
      pandemic. The composition of seminar speakers changed significantly. The
      share of seminars held by women increased. Several indicators of speaker
      productivity show that speakers at the top of the distribution also gained
      shares. The geography of knowledge dissemination shifted significantly as
      the distance between host and speaker institutions increased on average by
      32 percent. The results imply that the opportunity to offer virtual
      presentations instead of traveling to deliver in-person presentations can
      decrease gender-specific inequality and increase inequality in favor of
      the "stars" within the profession.

    title: On the Gender Diversity of Research Teams in Economics Seminars
    link: https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20231123
    subtitle: AEA Papers and Proceedings, Vol. 113, May 2023, pp. 473-76.
    description: Seminars are an important channel through which researchers receive
      feedback on their work and disseminate it. This paper presents descriptive
      evidence on the representation of female, male, and mixed teams in
      economics seminars. I use a balanced panel of 270 institutions in the
      academic years 2018–2020. I find that before COVID-19, only 7.4 percent of
      presented projects were authored by female teams, 59.2 percent of projects
      were authored by male teams, and 33.5 percent of projects were authored by
      mixed teams. The introduction of virtual seminars during the COVID-19
      pandemic led to more balanced distribution across team types.

    description: This paper investigates how management practices as intangible
      transfers are associated with the performance of multinational business
      groups. Differences in the management level across source countries are
      predictive for multinationals’ entry patterns for a given destination
      country. This study uses acquisitions as a means to transplant management
      practices from parents to affiliates abroad. It finds that better-managed
      parents decrease employment and increase productivity post-acquisition.
      The productivity gains are driven by targets with less developed
      management practices and by targets of larger parents. Better-managed
      parents are also more likely to install or retain a manager from the
      parent country post-acquisition.

      alt_link_2_url: https://journaldata.zbw.eu/dataset/trade-and-the-size-distribution-of-firms-evidence-from-the-german-empire
    description: What effect did trade have on the size distribution of firms during
      the first wave of globalization? Three historical datasets from the German
      Empire between 1875 and 1907 were collected and harmonized to answer this
      question. This paper combines industry census and bilateral railway trade
      data from the same industry and region along with industry-level tariff
      data. The evidence shows that increases in aggregate trade caused the
      share of firms to shift from smaller to larger firms. Exogenous decreases
      in tariffs caused an increase in the share of the largest firms. The
      regional distributive effects of trade on inequality between firms that
      are discussed in the contemporaneous literature were already present
      during the first wave globalization.
