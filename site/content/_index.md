      We study whether multinational corporations transmit the effects of a
      localized banking crisis to countries all over the world. We identify an
      exogenous shock to the credit supply of multinational parent corporations
      located in Germany. The shock to parents caused a reduction in the sales
      of their international affiliates for three years. We use unique data on
      linkages between parents and affiliates to study the transmission
      mechanism from parents’ credit supply to affiliates’ sales. Both financial
      and real channels played a role: Parents withdrew equity from their
      affiliates, reduced intra-firm trade with affiliates, and required more
      long-term lending from the affiliates. The results improve our
      understanding of the internal operations of multinational firms and
      suggest that multinationals contribute to global business cycle
      synchronization.

      Causal Evidence on the International Transmission of Crises Through
      Multinational Firms
  - description: >-
      What is the effect of trade on the size distribution of firms? I collected
      historical data between 1882 and 1907 from the German Empire to address
      this question. I can then match three data sets according to the same
      geographic boundaries: industry census data, railway and waterway trade
      data. The key findings are that trade integration impacts the firm size
      distribution heterogeneously across five size categories. I find evidence
      of a hierarchical and stark shift in employment and firm share from the
      smallest towards larger firm size categories. A “Bartik” instrument is
      proposed to argue that the correlations described are indeed causal. I
      provide evidence for a fall in transport costs and technology adoption as
      mechanisms to explain the stylized facts observed in the data.
