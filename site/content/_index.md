    description: This paper documents new evidence on how seminar speaking
      opportunities in economics are distributed across academic ranks. From a
      sample of 270 institutions, I determined that before the COVID-19
      pandemic, 34% of seminars were given by assistant professors, 20.4% of
      seminars were given by associate professors, and 45.6% by full professors.
      Following the COVID-19 shock, the share of associate professors increased.
      The participation of women rose at all ranks, with the most pronounced
      increase among female full professors, while the shares of male assistant
      and full professors declined.

    description: This article introduces a novel dataset on seminar presentations
      derived from acknowledgments in 20 top economics journals. I document that
      articles published in the top five journals are presented more frequently,
      with presentations being highly concentrated at 12 leading institutions,
      primarily in the Americas. Significant associations are found between
      presenting at Harvard and publishing in the Quarterly Journal of Economics
      (QJE), and between presenting at the University of Chicago and publishing
      in the Journal of Political Economy (JPE). Articles presented at Harvard
      and published in QJE have similar average citations but higher variance,
      with Harvard-affiliated authors more likely to receive below-median
      citations. JPE articles presented at the University of Chicago have
      similar average citations compared to other JPE publications.

    description: This paper investigates how firms’ international linkages to Russia
      and Ukraine affected investors’ expectations following the escalation of
      the Russian–Ukrainian war. For this, we perform an event study around the
      Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, finding that firms with
      significant trade activity with Russia experienced a substantial reduction
      in cumulative returns. The effect on cumula¬tive returns is especially
      pronounced for firms that are dependent on Russian com¬modities. The
      overall impact on the aggregate stock market performance of third
      countries was on average 1.5 percentage points. The highest losses were
      borne by European countries.

    title: "Bridging Barriers: How COVID-19 Changed Racial Diversity in Economics
      Seminars"
    link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016517652500182X
    description: In this paper, new facts are documented on the racial distribution
      of seminar speakers in economics. From a sample of 270 institutions, I
      determined that before the COVID-19 pandemic, 82.5% of seminars were given
      by White speakers, 13.9% of seminars were given by Asian speakers, and
      3.6% by speakers with a Hispanic-Latino or Black background. The racial
      distribution of speakers did not change globally. However, the share of
      speakers from underrepresented minorities in the United States almost
      doubled with the introduction of virtual seminars during the COVID-19
      pandemic.

  - title: Tracing the International Transmission of a Crisis Through Multinational
      Firms
    headline: ""
    description: We show that multinational firms transmit shocks across countries
      through their internal capital markets. We study a credit supply shock to
      parent firms in Germany. International affiliates outside Germany
      supported their parents through internal lending, became financially
      constrained themselves, and experienced lower real growth. We find that
      managers were "Darwinist" with respect to international affiliates but
      "Socialist" in the home country, that internal capital markets transmitted
      the credit shock more strongly than a non-financial shock, and that access
      to developed credit markets attenuated the real effects. The total real
      impact of shock transmission through multinationals on foreign economies
      was large.

  - title: "Remote Talks: Changes to Economics Seminars During COVID-19"
    description: This paper analyzes the consequences of the change in the
      presentation mode of economics seminars triggered by the COVID-19
      pandemic. The composition of seminar speakers changed significantly. The
      share of seminars held by women increased. Several indicators of speaker
      productivity show that speakers at the top of the distribution also gained
      shares. The geography of knowledge dissemination shifted significantly as
      the distance between host and speaker institutions increased on average by
      32 percent. The results imply that the opportunity to offer virtual
      presentations instead of traveling to deliver in-person presentations can
      decrease gender-specific inequality and increase inequality in favor of
      the "stars" within the profession.

    title: On the Gender Diversity of Research Teams in Economics Seminars

    description: Seminars are an important channel through which researchers receive
      feedback on their work and disseminate it. This paper presents descriptive
      evidence on the representation of female, male, and mixed teams in
      economics seminars. I use a balanced panel of 270 institutions in the
      academic years 2018–2020. I find that before COVID-19, only 7.4 percent of
      presented projects were authored by female teams, 59.2 percent of projects
      were authored by male teams, and 33.5 percent of projects were authored by
      mixed teams. The introduction of virtual seminars during the COVID-19
      pandemic led to more balanced distribution across team types.

    description: This paper investigates how management practices as intangible
      transfers are associated with the performance of multinational business
      groups. Differences in the management level across source countries are
      predictive for multinationals’ entry patterns for a given destination
      country. This study uses acquisitions as a means to transplant management
      practices from parents to affiliates abroad. It finds that better-managed
      parents decrease employment and increase productivity post-acquisition.
      The productivity gains are driven by targets with less developed
      management practices and by targets of larger parents. Better-managed
      parents are also more likely to install or retain a manager from the
      parent country post-acquisition.

    description: What effect did trade have on the size distribution of firms during
      the first wave of globalization? Three historical datasets from the German
      Empire between 1875 and 1907 were collected and harmonized to answer this
      question. This paper combines industry census and bilateral railway trade
      data from the same industry and region along with industry-level tariff
      data. The evidence shows that increases in aggregate trade caused the
      share of firms to shift from smaller to larger firms. Exogenous decreases
      in tariffs caused an increase in the share of the largest firms. The
      regional distributive effects of trade on inequality between firms that
      are discussed in the contemporaneous literature were already present
      during the first wave globalization.
