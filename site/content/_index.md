  - title: Tracing the International Transmission of a Crisis Through Multinational
      Firms

    description: " This paper shows that idiosyncratic shocks to individual firms
      can affect growth all over the world, even if shocked firms have no direct
      foreign connections and no operations abroad. We identify an idiosyncratic
      shock to a German bank, which caused the bank to cut lending to German
      borrowers. Multinational parent firms located in Germany became
      financially constrained. In response, international affiliates of affected
      parents supported their parent by lending through internal capital markets
      and became constrained themselves. The real growth of affiliates fell
      sharply and took three years to fully recover. Though the initial shock
      only hit the domestic activities of a firm in Germany, the impact in other
      countries was sizable (for instance, around 0.4 percent of aggregate sales
      in Austria and the Czech Republic). The findings reveal that idiosyncratic
      shocks to individual firms influence economic outcomes far beyond firms’
      direct scope of operation."

    description: We study how firms’ international linkages to Russia and Ukraine
      have affected investors’ expectations following the outbreak of the
      Russian-Ukrainian war. We perform an event study around the Russian
      invasion into Ukraine on February 24, 2022. We find that having trade
      linkages to Russia in the top decile is associated with a decrease in the
      cumulative return by 2.16 percentage points and having an affiliate in
      Russia with a decrease by 3.12 percentage points. Having an affiliate in
      Ukraine has, however, no effect on firms’ stock market returns. The total
      impact of trade linkages on the aggregate stock market performance of
      third countries was on average 0.8 percentage points and of multinational
      linkages was on average 0.73 percentage points. The losses were largest in
      European countries.

      This paper analyzes the consequences of the change in the presentation
      mode of

      economics seminars triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The composition of seminar speakers changed significantly. The share of seminars held by women increased.

      The leading economists in terms of recent output and top young top economists also

      gained shares. The geography of knowledge dissemination shifted significantly as

      the distance between host and speaker institutions increased on average by 32 percent.

      The growing inequality in presentations among speakers is correlated with an

      increase in inequality in terms of citations. The results imply that virtual presentations

      instead of traveling can decrease gender-specific inequality and increase inequality by

      productivity in the profession.

    description: The Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE) managed by Harvard
      University and the Journal of Political Economy (JPE) managed by the
      University of Chicago are two of the top five journals in the economics
      profession. Drawing on the acknowledgements of about 2,300 publications in
      the top five journals, this article documents a robust and significant
      correlation between presenting at Harvard University and publishing in the
      QJE and between presenting at the University of Chicago and publishing in
      the JPE. Articles presented at Harvard (Chicago) and published in the QJE
      (JPE) have a similar impact in terms of citations as other articles
      published in the QJE (JPE).

    description: This paper investigates how management practices as intangible
      transfers are associated with the performance of multinational business
      groups. Differences in the management level across source countries are
      predictive for multinationals’ entry patterns for a given destination
      country. This study uses acquisitions as a means to transplant management
      practices from parents to affiliates abroad. It finds that better-managed
      parents decrease employment and increase productivity post-acquisition.
      The productivity gains are driven by targets with less developed
      management practices and by targets of larger parents. Better-managed
      parents are also more likely to install or retain a manager from the
      parent country post-acquisition.

      alt_link_2_url: https://journaldata.zbw.eu/dataset/trade-and-the-size-distribution-of-firms-evidence-from-the-german-empire
    description: What effect did trade have on the size distribution of firms during
      the first wave of globalization? Three historical datasets from the German
      Empire between 1875 and 1907 were collected and harmonized to answer this
      question. This paper combines industry census and bilateral railway trade
      data from the same industry and region along with industry-level tariff
      data. The evidence shows that increases in aggregate trade caused the
      share of firms to shift from smaller to larger firms. Exogenous decreases
      in tariffs caused an increase in the share of the largest firms. The
      regional distributive effects of trade on inequality between firms that
      are discussed in the contemporaneous literature were already present
      during the first wave globalization.
